### Reverse Engineering of Minecraft a1.1.2_01 version

##### Only for **study** purposes

---

## How I run this?

- Firstly, I tested this project on windows only, then... use linux or mac at your own risk (I believe this is ONLY due to the **.bat** scripts).

- Use **Intellij** (or other IDE, but at your own risk).

- Download the **"a1.1.2_01.jar"** minecraft version from original repository.

- Drag this .jar on **"bin\minecraft.jar"** (renaming "a1.1.2_01" to "minecraft").

- Run the **"prepare.bat"** script.

- Open the project on Intellij.

- Install the **"corretto-1.8.0_302"** when Intellij asks for the sdk (I think this is not the correct version for the game, maybe I will change it later, but while everything is running normally it will continue).

- Select the **"Run"** configuration.

- And, finnaly, **RUN**!

## Why?

I originally wanted to make a seed cracker, maybe I'll go ahead and implement the logic of that, but earlier this year (2021) Minecraft@Home posted a video saying that they (andrew_555 and a few others) cracked the herobrine seed on a1.1.2. What is awesome!!! But... what's left for me now? (hahahaahhah) My new goal is crack the seed of "monark" (a popular brazilian youtuber) who played this version and was responsible for the beginning of the dissemination of minecraft here in brazil.

Thanks to the MCP devs. I used one of their patches to fix some artifacts from the decompilation.
